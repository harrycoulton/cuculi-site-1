# CuculiSite


This is a current work in progress, where I am working with a new folk music record label in Bristol to design and build a bespoke website. At present, the frontend is a static site hosted on AWS. You can find the site here: https://cuculirecords.com/


Iâ€™m currently building the backend CMS in NodeJS Express with Typescript. Once I have finished the CMS, I am planning on setting the frontend up with server-side rendering, and a CI pipeline from CodeCommit. 


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.
